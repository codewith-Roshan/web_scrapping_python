“Do what you think is best, but be the best in what you do.” – Kamalnayan Bajaj

These words embody the spirit of Bajaj Auto. From 1945 to today, from “Hamara Bajaj” to “The World’s Favourite Indian”- the most loved motorcycle brands in almost 80 countries, Bajaj Auto carries its rich legacy and unconventional thinking, with a penchant for staunch differentiation.

•	A Zero Debt 3.5 Billion Dollar Company
•	Word’s largest three-wheeler manufacturer and third largest two-wheeler manufacturer
•	India’s Number 1 motorcycle exporter – 2 out of every 3 motorcycles exported are Bajaj
•	Single largest exporter of Branded Goods – exporting 50% of India’s two and three-wheelers
•	Over 40% revenue from International markets with 15+ million motorcycles sold

With powerful brands, our spectrum ranges from Boxer in Africa to KTM in Europe, from Rouser in Latin America to Pulsar in India, our versatility is evident. International alliances with KTM, Husqvarna, and Triumph has ensured that our horizons are broadened.

A pioneer in motorcycle technology, our R&D is world-class with talent from all corners of the globe with TPM being the prime mover of productivity for the last 25 years. From lean manufacturing, we have now moved to lean engineering & lean marketing, which has led to globally competitive fixed costs.

Our vision is to enable 100 million small businesses in India, including individual entrepreneurs, to succeed online. Meesho is democratising internet commerce by bringing a range of products and new customers online. What started, six years ago, as a reseller-focused platform enabling millions to sell online, has now emerged as a single ecosystem connecting sellers to consumers and entrepreneurs. 

Our Vision:  Enable 100M small businesses in India to succeed online

Our Mission:  Democratise internet commerce for everyone

India has nearly 60 million MSMEs and Meesho’s long term goal is to enable 100 million businesses to pave their paths of success online across India. With our vision firmly in place, we intend to simplify eCommerce for all small businesses in India. This will help us build a platform which is pro-small businesses with policies and tools to help even the smallest of sellers to list and conduct business on Meesho. We are confident that this will empower small business owners to reach customers through all online channels.

Our Story

Meesho was started by Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal with the idea to enable mom and pop stores to sell online in 2016. They soon realised that their primary users were sellers who didn't own a shop, but sold through their social network and went on to build a product to democratise social commerce, enabling literally anyone to start their own venture. Soon after, they pivoted to enabling social sellers/entrepreneurs to monetise their network by providing supply, logistics and payments infrastructure.

Meesho was started by Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal with the idea of enabling mom & pop stores to sell online in 2016. They soon realised that their primary users were actually sellers who did not own a shop, but sold through their social network. They understood that this is how small businesses will work in the future and built a product to democratise social commerce and enable literally anyone to start their own venture. They quickly pivoted to enabling social sellers/entrepreneurs monetise their network by providing supply, logistics and payments infrastructure. 

From its humble beginnings, Meesho has successfully enabled over 15M+ individual entrepreneurs to start their own online businesses with zero investment, bringing e-commerce to more than 45M+ customers across India. 

Till date the company has delivered orders from 100K+ registered suppliers to over 27,000 pin codes in more than 5,000 cities and towns, generating over 500 crore in income for individual entrepreneurs and serving customers in more than 4,500 Tier 2+ cities — truly bringing e-commerce to Bharat.

In just five months since the last round of funding in April, Meesho has recorded 2.5x growth in order volume and added several new product categories to its roster including sports and
fitness, pet supplies, and automotive accessories. It intends to go deeper into
India’s underserved markets, becoming the preferred eCommerce destination for the next billion
users in the country.

Meesho is Series F funded (its largest round yet) and has raised $570 million led by Fidelity Management And Research Company, B Capital Group, Footpath Ventures, Trifecta Capital, and others. Existing investors SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Prosus Ventures, and Facebook have also participated in this round. This latest round brings Meesho’s valuation to USD 4.9 billion. With an aim to reach 100 million monthly transacting users by December 2022, Meesho will utilize the fresh round of funding to grow its technology and product talent by 2.5x, increase its roster to 50+ million products, and become the platform of choice for customers, entrepreneurs and sellers across India.

We love to work on new challenges, break free from legacy thinking, and seek new ways to unlock growth for businesses by Outgrowing the Ordinary.

Internalize Agility with Integrity - Find exciting reasons to be restless. It’s important to execute quickly and flawlessly.

Customers are our one true love - Every problem Razors identify starts with the customer and every solution ends at the customer’s total satisfaction.

Razorpay grows with Razors! - Razors are empowered to learn, debate, experiment, lead, and fail as long as they keep growing and learning.

Back in 2008, Vivek Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi worked as software engineers at Amazon and IBM, respectively, spending way too much time on engineering interviews. The duo wished they could focus more energy on building innovative products and less energy screening resumes and interviewing. Plus, it was really hard to spot great programmers using traditional recruiting methods.
Together, they built automatic CodeChallenges that not only cut thousands of hours in recruiting collectively but also helped flatten the world by promoting a meritocracy. This innovation earned a spot at the prestigious Y Combinator startup accelerator program. And so HackerRank was born.
About us:
HackerRank is a Y Combinator alumnus backed by tier one Silicon Valley VCs. We are a skills-based hiring platform that helps companies evaluate technical skills, better.

We believe every company is a work in progress and we deeply care for our people, their happiness, career, and feedback.

We have conviction and belief in what we do and we believe the attention to anonymous feedback is a distraction in our focus and a waste of our time and effort.

We are convinced anonymous feedback deserves no attention in a professional environment. We believe anonymous feedback is against fundamental professional ethics and promotes wrong, destructive culture. If someone does not believe in their own views and does not have the courage to speak up, such feedback is a waste of management time and energy.

At that point Deepanshu had been trying and failing to get a PG seat since 2 years and had lost hopes.
They got together to brainstorm ideas for a platform that could help such MBBS grads take the next big leap in their career.
With an initial investment of INR 40,000 and a residential basement as office, the two started building PrepLadder and chasing an impossible vision.
PrepLadder quickly became popular among young students across the country and the team grew.
In 2018, the founders went on a mission to create the Dream Team for Medical PG preparation. In a time when best faculties preferred taking classes offline, this was an industry level disruption.
While other companies were flooding the industry with investor money, PrepLadder pursued no external help and relied on their vision to get faculties to join them
It took one whole year to build the Dream Team. A team of 19 legends, best in their own field and aligned with PrepLadder’s goal. With the launch of a new app, new content, notes and other supportive features in 2019, PrepLadder has changed the industry forever. We’re no longer a testing platform- We’re a growing ecosystem.

Happay was founded in 2012 with a simple idea: paying someone, be it friends, family or colleagues should be as easy as sending a text message. With this in mind, we built our first consumer product, the happay mobile app- a mobile wallet that allows you to pay just about anyone, anywhere, with their mobile number. No bank account details required.

A BIGGER VISION
Over time we observed that, as consumers we have a lot of freedom and flexibility when we pay for things; but same is not true for businesses. The way businesses pay for and manage their expenses has remained the same for decades. This mismatch led us to create a new vision for happay (making payments a happy experience for businesses) and to develop a new product to support this vision. One area of business payments we focused on was business expense management.

Backstory: 

The journey of Locus from being a women’s safety application to a leading logistics optimization platform, is an interesting one. In 2015, Nishith Rastogi and Geet Garg developed RideSafe, a women’s safety geo-tracking app to track deviations from pre-defined ride routes.

It was soon adopted by food tech companies to track deviations of their delivery staff. This gave Nishith and Geet material insight that there was clearly a lack of a decision-making system in logistics. This realization was the pivotal foresight that led to the building of Locus, an end-to-end dispatch planning and route optimization platform for supply chain enterprises.

From 2015 till date , Locus has grown by leaps and bounds, with a clear focus on innovating consistently"

3421,Harris Computer,4.2,673Reviews,11,318,28 office locations,10000+ Employees,Enterprise Software & Network Solutions,"Harris Computer was founded in 1976 by Nigel Harris. The idea was a computer-operated automated accounting system. Today, these are taken for granted, but in 1975, this was a revolutionary idea.

With some early successes, Harris knew that the next challenge was funding the cost of developing products that could work with the often-antiquated hardware and software that their customers owned.

As this was taking place, the pace of change in the computer and software industries was accelerating. Harris found itself playing catch-up almost right from the start. The problem was the equipment. It was already outdated. So, Harris and his team decided to focus their own activities around two simple ideas: finish the work they had started for customers and spend time with customers and prospects, to understand the emerging needs of their segment of the embryonic business software industry.

What wasn’t changing was the practice of customers buying hardware from one company, and customized software from another.  Nigel Harris had a different idea: what if the customer was offered a single support experience that combined both hardware and software?

The market was quite responsive, and Harris Computer began to thrive. The combination of custom software and support for that software on the DEC platform gave Harris an early and potent competitive advantage.

Always thinking, Nigel Harris realized that custom software projects often became bogged down in activities needed to complete the code. Success here was the difference between an unhappy customer and a satisfied one.

He also noticed that many customers bought new applications that hadn’t been written before. There was a gap between customer expectations for such code and what the vendor was able to deliver. 

The challenge was to close both gaps at once. Harris Computer did so by pivoting away from its roots. The solution was simple and powerful: If a company could write software that solved the majority of needs of a large number of customers without being written from scratch each time, that company could also invest in building software that exceeded customer expectations by meeting their very specific business processes and use cases.

Today this is called vertical market software. Then, it was called inspired thinking.

But Harris didn’t have the requisite vertical to serve. He and his team began to search for a vertical that was unique, complex, and had minimal competition thereby providing fertile ground for growth.

In 1996, twenty years after the founding of N. Harris Computer Corporation, Nigel sold to Constellation Software Inc…putting into motion the next chapter.

After the sale to CSI, Nigel Harris went on to be a serial entrepreneur, starting ventures in multiple markets. But he never lost touch with his first creation, saying “All these years later, I’m grateful for the job that Constellation and the Harris leadership team have done with my baby. Every time I drive by the Harris offices I feel a great sense of pride.”

Investing was a pain in the back for customers then. It took anywhere between a few days to a couple of weeks just to complete the KYC. The difficulty of sieving through the jargon around financial products made it even more painful. Thus, from the very beginning, we had a single goal - to make investing as simple, accessible, and trustworthy as possible.

Since then, while a lot has changed, many things have remained the same. We still see investing as a complex activity, everything is jargon-filled, mis-selling is rampant, and personalization at scale is absent. We at Fisdom remain stoked about solving these challenges for our customers.

In 2016, we started with just one product - mutual funds. But we have several firsts to our name. Fisdom was the first company in India to completely digitize account opening and KYC process - something which subsequently became the industry standard. Also, we’re the first company in India to introduce the use of a payment gateway to process mutual fund transactions on the BSE platform. We were also the first to digitise Pension funds (NPS) completely. Another first for ours was launching a goal-based investment solution.

Over the next 3 years, we added insurance, tax filing, and stock broking. Recently, we also added an HNI wealth management business to serve the mass-affluent and affluent segment of customers.

We have pioneered in B2B2C distribution model, which has disrupted the Indian Wealth-Tech industry. Today we are partnered with 15 plus leading banks in the country giving us exclusive, non-competitive, and efficient access to a customer base of over 40 crore Indians.  

Our bank partnerships give us unprecedented access to customers in Tier 1, 2, 3 and 4 locations across India, making us a truly built-for-bharat company.

Some of the Top Banks in India that  trust Fisdom for their customer’s wealth are : 
Public sector banks: 
Indian Bank, UCO Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Punjab National Bank, India Post Payment Bank
o	Private Banks: 
Karnataka Bank, City Union Bank, Tamilnadu Mercantile Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank, State Bank of Mauritius"

BetterPlace has been that ecosystem, since 2015.

One of the most challenging aspects of running a company is workforce management, particularly for frontline employees. Additionally, companies are constantly looking for dependable, all-inclusive workforce management solutions that may aid in streamlining their organization's complex HR-related activities.

By streamlining complex workforce management and HR processes through state-of-the-art, full-stack HR technology, we empower Indian businesses of all calibers with comprehensive workforce management solutions for all the components of the blue & grey-collar workforce lifecycle.

We manage the complete lifecycle of an enterprise’s frontline workforce from one single SaaS-based HRMS platform, by providing them services such as assessment of job seekers, digital onboarding, KYC, training, attendance management, payroll, workforce fulfillment, upskilling, and compliance. Additionally, BetterPlace also provides wide options of insurance, merchandise and credit benefits (with its network of partners) as it builds a strong ecosystem for addressing the entire value chain of this workforce in India

We also bring enterprises and gig-workers on a single platform which enables enterprises to reduce operational costs and increase gig-workers’ earnings per hour.

Today, BetterPlace is India’s largest full-stack HR tech platform for frontline workforce management serving over 1000 enterprises.

We really don’t want candidates to worry about their personal development or career aspirations: how and where to find genuine employment opportunities, how to reskill or upskill, what courses to sign up for, amongst several other pressing concerns. Nor do we want to leave employers wishing for a talent pool teeming with pre-verified and pre-skilled candidates. 

If you see yourself tackling these challenges head on with a team of highly-driven professionals, Join Us! 

Help us refine Rocket, our B2C venture, which provides more than a million verified job opportunities in the blue & gray-collar segment and hosts a wide variety of upskilling and social learning opportunities to 400mn+ diaspora of blue-collar workers in India.

We are helping organisations and startups get access to a large pool of pre-skilled and pre-verified workforce before anyone else. And changing the way workforce management works in India by enabling organisations to identify gaps in their labour force and then empower them through our all-in-one platform. 

Unlike other HR Tech platforms, we're dedicated to identifying gaps and working towards solving them—a commitment we call ""experimentation for impact.""

Fliplearn’s vision is to impact over 1 billion homework assignments given each day in India. The novel and unprecedented ‘Learning Transformation System’ also aims to revolutionize the way homework and assessments are presently created, assigned, attempted, graded, and shared with and by the students.

While the various aspects of education – curriculum, instruction and assessment have been amply impacted by the Ed Tech solutions, homework continues to be a monotonous and boring aspect in the lives of teachers and students. Fliplearn’s LTS aims to invigorate this aspect and present intricate data points and detailed analytics on a child’s day-to-day performance and enable teachers to plough this feedback almost instantly on an everyday level without adding to their workload while reducing their mundane tasks drastically.

Fliplearn LTS provides a solution to the common concerns of parents, students, and teachers in relation to learning and homework. This revolutionary system seeks to eliminate the associated stress and resistance while making the learning journey more fun and enjoyable for all the stakeholders."

-Ratan Tata

To achieve something monumental, you need to work with people who carry this mindset. They not only lay the foundation but act as pillars for the mission.

At Saarthi.ai, we apply this saying in our daily lives. We are like a close-knit family as well as a passionate squad.

We at Saarthi.ai don’t call one another Employees but we call ourselves Team Members. We believe we are part of a Team, and our roles and responsibilities extend beyond ‘tasks’. We work ‘with’ everyone and ‘for’ the Purpose!

The Team is comprised of members from various parts of the nation and different walks of life. And we all play together to achieve common goals. We believe such diversity and inclusion builds a winning culture as well as great products.

Saarthi.ai goes about its mission while ensure the future its building is sustainable. The company is focussed on being the world’s leading Contact Center AI company, while keeping privacy, environment and advancement of humanity as its core values.

Saarthi.ai is a Purpose First and People Centric company.

· Upskill themselves- Collaborate with curious, hard-working people (great minds) to learn, contribute, and evolve together.

· Grow faster- Utilize the steep learning curve and challenges to accelerate your personal and professional development. Get closer to achieving your true potential as a person.

· Own Great Responsibilities- Get to feel the impact of what you are doing. Rather than seeing things as individual tasks, you get the platform at Saarthi.ai to know what purpose is your work fulfilling.

· Co-create the Future- You are not just updated with the current times but you are actively changing the status quo (current times) and building the future.

· Meet their Crazy - You don't get to meet crazy people everyday with crazy ideas. People will generally go from 1 to 2 but not 1 to 100. Such people accelerate/propel even your dreams / growth. And, they are approachable, like minded and you are gathered for a common purpose. So, you are able to discuss/reason/argue and make even that idea crazier (better). If people describe you as crazy or a misfit, you are in the right place. Come for the purpose ; Stay for the people.

· Generate Wealth - You join when the mission is at its early stages or the company is many orders of magnitude less of its true potential. And, when you make it big together, you have played a part in shaping it and creating value for everyone. This generates wealth and a sense of accomplishment.

These values help us improve with every passing day.

o Advance Humanity

Our attention to service and continuous improvement helps us to earn our position as the highest-rated tax agent in Australia. Etax also won the CANSTAR 2018 ""Most Satisfied Customers"" award.
We employ LOTS of accountants, including hundreds of highly-qualified and certified accountants and registered tax agents.

Grads are paid to learn at Etax.
We also employ software developers, administrators, marketers and managers with many different specialities. 
Although our grad program and review accounting jobs mainly involve temporary or casual seasonal work, our core workforce is highly engaged year-round and we have a remarkably low staff turnover, with MANY people passing their ten-year mark at Etax.
 Why? Because Etax is a positive-minded business that values loyalty, honesty, family, collaboration and a genuine commitment to providing good service to clients."

Mothercare Global Brand is a business-to-business company. It develops the Mothercare strategy, maximising the value of our global brand, designing own-brand products and – as custodians of the brand – defining the ‘Mothercare way’, all of which are distributed around the globe through franchising partnerships. In fact, we are the world’s largest parent-and-baby franchise.

Today, we have 840 stores in 40 countries through our franchise network. In FY19, our international sales turnover was in excess of £600 million.

That’s big. But we’re not content.

There are 60 million births around the globe each year – so there’s a huge market to play for. We will harness our reputation as a trusted brand and work in partnership with our franchisees to grow. We’ll do that in a planned, strategic and commercially-minded way that enables a sustainable, long-term future for the Mothercare brand.

We’ve also just announced a fantastic new franchise with Boots. Boots will exclusively sell Mothercare-branded products – from clothing to car seats to pushchairs – in their UK stores. That means we’re bringing Mothercare back to the high street in partnership with another highly regarded British brand.


We’re just finalising the deal but anticipate that Boots will start to carry Mothercare-branded products from Summer 2020.

That solution is Brennan IT. 

So how did we go about it?  Well, by ensuring we offered the mid-market exactly what they wanted: professionalism, know-how, simplicity and the same passion for their business as they have. 

Everything about how we work is optimised to ensure the experience is absolutely exceptional. Brennan IT goes to great lengths to create a team that is unified in its unerring focus on keeping customers happy no matter what it takes. Because of course, there’ll always be other companies who can provide you with the same technology; how we do it is where the magic lies.

True to purpose
Twenty years later, the Brennan IT team remain committed to the original purpose of making business easier for our clients. Good thing too, as today it’s even harder for mid-market businesses to get the support they deserve. Not to mention how rapid evolution of technology only makes IT harder for the mid-market to keep up with.

At Brennan IT our promise is to continually innovate and evolve to deliver on the needs of our clients, to own customer issues, and to act with genuine care. We aspire to be the best mid-market technology and business partner — today, tomorrow and in the future."

As one enters the Campus the air is vibrant with the dynamic energy of students. We believe in Integral student development and so have an amalgamation of curricular, co-curricular and extracurricular activities.
This is as we believe in what J Krishnamurti has aptly stated: “To understand a child we have to watch him at play, study him in his different moods; we cannot project upon him our own prejudices, hopes and fears, or mould him to fit the pattern of our desires.Mere technical training inevitably makes for ruthlessness, and to educate our children we must be sensitive to the whole movement of life. What we think, what we do, what we say matters infinitely, because it creates the environment, and the environment either helps or hinders the child.” Each department boasts of Center of Excellence that integrates industry practices with academic learning.We at the Energy Audit Center undertake Consulting and also deliver Power Quality reports.At the Intellectual Property Facilitation Center we assist students to transform their innovative ideas into products.
Zeal Education Society conducts Zeal Drag race every year and we get the racing DNA of students unleashed. As students from other colleges also participate in the event, it is a joyous experience. Our students hone their talent and skills at the in-house basketball Club, Shooting Academy, Cricket Club, Football Club, Fitness Club and Yoga Center. They also use the Meditation Center to unwind and internalise to strike a balance within.
As a result of the altruistic Values imbibed in them as part of the Zeal Culture our students collect food grains for drought affected farmers. We don’t just provide a degree that facilitates earning a livelihood- we make citizens who have humane values to value life.
This is a brief glimpse of the Life at Zeal and we have shared student testimonials to give an insight to various activities that are a part of everyday life at Zeal.

Publicis Groupe Talent Equation - Publicis Groupe’s philosophy revolves around the equation: (IQ + EQ + TQ)

Intellectual Quotient, Technology Quotient and Emotional Quotient to power creativity and disruption.
The talent we recruit has to score high on these elements:

•	Intellectual Quotient (IQ): any approach to brand communication or product marketing requires serious thought and astute strategic counsel. Coupled with the need to transform a business model or marketing strategy, it’s led to the development of consulting as an activity in its own right. A strong IQ is therefore crucial to face the challenges of the Digital Age.
•	Technology Quotient (TQ): we know how to make the most of the unprecedented capabilities of new technologies.
•	Emotional Quotient (EQ): it’s the heart of our business and what makes us stand out. EQ, powered by creativity, ensures the success of the greatest alchemies, valorizing and transcending Publicis Groupe’s offer to bring a vital touch of humanity to our brand content.

Because only people deliver value, we focus on our people and what they care about.

Our Groupe is home to the most tech-savvy, creative, passionate, value-creating people in the industry.

We provide them with an environment based on accountability, merit and trust that enables the brightest, most creative, highly dedicated people to do best work of their lives.

It’s people that have built the adventure of this company over the past 90 years. And wherever they are in the network, we value them, we invest in them, and we empower them. Because it’s their energy, their creativity and their dedication that give us our strength.

Driven by a strong sense of purpose and the desire to get it right, we give creativity a free reign every day, in every corner of our business, to add value for our clients - and therefore, our people.

We want to be admired as a hotbed of learning and development for the most ambitious and talented people in the creative industries.

When asked, our clients say that what they value in their relationships with us is:

1.	Expert and senior talent on the front line
2.	Flexibility
3.	A genuine holistic approach
4.	Solid data and analytics that reveal opportunities and elevate work
5.	Fresh and surprising creative ideas
6.	Creativity applied in the broadest possible sense - across strategy, data analysis, media, and creative execution

4739,Sequretek,3.5,75Reviews,79,13,"Mumbai, MH",201 to 500 Employees,Enterprise Software & Network Solutions,"Sequretek is a B2B cybersecurity firm that was formed in November 2013 with a vision “to simplify security by consolidating the technology landscape”.  

Today the company has a physical presence with offices in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru in India, and New Jersey in the US, with a team strength of over 400 cyber security aware professionals who do an outstanding job of building world-class security products as well as services over 100 customers across Finance, Manufacturing, Services, and Retail. 

If you look at any technology-led industry it goes through a curve where there is an aspect of newness and complexity in the beginning and over a while it undergoes consolidation, simplification, and commoditization. The security industry seems to be going the other way where every year a plethora of new technology areas, new products, and new players emerge making the whole play muddled. Today there are over 90 different technologies from 3500 different companies in a 50 billion $ security product and an equal amount services market. Making security amongst the most fragmented market in the tech space. 

Cyber Security industry, therefore, ends up getting divided into the world of have's and have not's - where the Top 10% of the customers have access to know-how, resources, and attention whilst the balance 90% neither have the resources or financial wherewithal to understand what they need, why they need, what works best for them and then how to make the right decision and then be able to live with it. There is way too much buyer’s remorse and consequential churn here. There is a space for a company like Sequretek who through its offerings could become a one-stop shop for the ""Have Not's"". 

The problem of heterogeneity and complexity has created real-life challenges for customers as they look at figuring out how their environments are responding to the increased cyber threats. 

•	Challenge 1: Technology sprawl – too many point technologies needed to create a security mesh 
•	Challenge 2: Visibility mess – with each product working independently resulting in lack of visibility on threats
•	Challenge 3: Data sprawl – structured and unstructured security data across multiple systems makes analysis difficult
•	Challenge 4: Botched response – all of the above results in ineffective incident response

Sequretek’s Percept Cloud Security Platform (CSP) is created to address this specific challenge. Percept CSP provides end-to-end security in the areas of enterprise threat monitoring & response, device security, and identity & access governance. 

1) Percept Endpoint Detection and Response (“EDR”): An endpoint security product that ensures that no malicious files infect your endpoints using AI and ML, and self-updates to fix existing vulnerabilities. The product is Day 1 deployment ready along with 24x7 management and monitoring.
2) Percept Identity Governance and Administration (“IGA”): An end-user access governance offering for employee lifecycle management ensuring that employees get the right access at the right time. The product offers enhanced features like AI-based user behavior cases, single sign-on, multifactor authentication, and user access review.
3) Percept Extended Detection and Response (“XDR”): Predictive threat detection and analytics, threat hunting, and threat mitigation using deep learning algorithms, big data lakes, and automated incident orchestration layer. The product offers over 600 use cases across Threat Intelligence, Malware Intelligence, User Behaviour, and Entity Behaviour analytics."
